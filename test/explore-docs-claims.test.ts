// Sixteen lines across both documentation trees used to state that `explore`
// creates no artifacts and writes no files, full stop (#1833). That has been
// false since explore shipped (#467): the capture branch of
// `src/core/templates/workflows/explore.ts` writes the planning artifacts the
// user asked for, and can edit an existing change's artifacts. #1503 later
// made it scaffold with `openspec new change` first. What stays true is narrower: explore never writes code,
// and it writes nothing you did not ask for or agree to.
//
// This sweep keeps the absolute wording retired, the same way
// test/vocabulary-sweep.test.ts keeps the pre-rename store vocabulary retired.
// It is deliberately a flat list of phrasings over a named page list rather
// than a grammar for the claim. An earlier draft tried the grammar - section
// splitting, fence tracking, a conditional-marker exemption - and it was
// imprecise in both directions on realistic prose while returning the same
// verdict here. Phrasings that are only wrong in the absolute ("writes
// nothing", "creates nothing") are left to review, because "writes nothing
// unless you ask" is the wording this very test recommends.
