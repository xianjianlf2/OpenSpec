# opsx-verify-skill Specification

## Purpose
Define `/opsx:verify` behavior for assessing implementation completeness, correctness, and coherence against change artifacts.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Verify Skill Invocation
The system SHALL provide an `/opsx:verify` skill that validates implementation against change artifacts.

#### Scenario: Verify with change name provided
- **WHEN** agent executes `/opsx:verify <change-name>`
- **THEN** the agent verifies implementation for that specific change
- **AND** produces a verification report

#### Scenario: Verify without change name
- **WHEN** agent executes `/opsx:verify` without a change name
- **THEN** the agent infers the change from conversation context, or auto-selects it when only one active change exists
- **AND** when ambiguous, prompts user to select from all active changes, including changes with no tracked tasks
- **AND** announces which change was selected and how to override

#### Scenario: Change has no task descriptions
- **WHEN** the schema configures task tracking but the structured task list provides no usable task descriptions, even if task progress reports nonzero totals
- **THEN** the agent reports Task Completion as not verified with the reason
- **AND** continues checks supported by the remaining artifacts

#### Scenario: Schema has no task tracking
- **WHEN** the schema does not configure `apply.tracks`
- **THEN** apply instructions report `taskTrackingConfigured: false`
- **AND** the agent reports Task Completion as not applicable, not as skipped or failed
- **AND** continues the checks that apply to the schema

### Requirement: Completeness Verification
The agent SHALL verify that all required work has been completed.

#### Scenario: Task completion check
- **WHEN** verifying completeness
- **THEN** the agent uses the top-level `tasks` and `progress` from apply instructions
- **AND** apply instructions aggregate every concrete file matched by the active schema's `apply.tracks`, regardless of the tracked artifact's ID
- **AND** reports complete and total task counts from `progress`
- **AND** reports completion status with specific incomplete tasks listed
- **AND** reports remaining checkboxes without descriptions when `progress.remaining` exceeds the listed incomplete tasks

#### Scenario: Tracking evidence becomes unavailable
- **WHEN** one or more files matched by `apply.tracks` cannot be read after resolution
- **THEN** apply instructions include every unavailable path and reason
- **AND** preserve tasks and progress from readable tracking files
- **AND** do not report `all_done`
- **AND** the agent marks Task Completion as not verified from partial evidence

#### Scenario: Spec coverage check
- **WHEN** verifying completeness
- **AND** delta specs exist in `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`
- **THEN** the agent extracts all requirements from delta specs, noting the delta section each one sits under
- **AND** searches codebase for implementation of each ADDED or MODIFIED requirement
- **AND** reports which ADDED or MODIFIED requirements appear to have implementation vs which are missing
- **AND** checks REMOVED and RENAMED requirements as described in the Removed requirement and Renamed requirement scenarios

#### Scenario: All tasks complete
- **WHEN** all tasks are marked complete
- **THEN** report "Tasks: N/N complete"
- **AND** mark Task Completion as passed only when task descriptions are available
- **AND** mark the completeness dimension as passed only when all applicable checks ran and passed

#### Scenario: Incomplete tasks found
- **WHEN** some tasks are incomplete
- **THEN** report "Tasks: X/N complete"
- **AND** list each incomplete task
- **AND** mark as CRITICAL issue
- **AND** suggest: "Complete remaining tasks or mark as done if already implemented"

### Requirement: Correctness Verification
The agent SHALL verify that implementation matches the specifications.

#### Scenario: Requirement implementation mapping
- **WHEN** verifying correctness
- **THEN** for each ADDED or MODIFIED requirement in delta specs:
  - Search codebase for implementation
  - Identify relevant files and line numbers
  - Assess whether implementation satisfies the requirement

#### Scenario: Scenario coverage check
- **WHEN** verifying correctness
- **THEN** for each scenario under an ADDED or MODIFIED requirement in delta specs:
  - Check if the scenario's conditions are handled in code
  - Check if tests exist that cover the scenario
  - Report coverage status

#### Scenario: Implementation matches spec
- **WHEN** implementation appears to satisfy a requirement
- **THEN** report which files/lines implement it
- **AND** mark requirement as covered

#### Scenario: Implementation diverges from spec
- **WHEN** implementation exists but doesn't match spec intent
- **THEN** report the divergence as WARNING
- **AND** explain what differs
- **AND** suggest: either update implementation or update spec to match reality

#### Scenario: Missing implementation
- **WHEN** no implementation found for an ADDED or MODIFIED requirement
- **THEN** report as CRITICAL issue
- **AND** suggest: "Implement requirement X" with guidance on what's needed

#### Scenario: Removed requirement
- **WHEN** a requirement sits under `## REMOVED Requirements` in a delta spec
- **THEN** the agent treats the absence of its implementation as the expected result
- **AND** does not report it as missing or suggest implementing it
- **AND** reports it as CRITICAL only if the removed behavior is still present in the codebase
- **AND** skips scenario coverage for it
- **AND** does not treat matches in OpenSpec artifacts or docs, or in code that serves only the Migration note or an ADDED requirement, as evidence by themselves
- **AND** still reports a code path that delivers the removed behavior, even when it is shared with an ADDED requirement

#### Scenario: Renamed requirement
- **WHEN** a requirement is listed under `## RENAMED Requirements` in a delta spec
- **THEN** the agent does not report its FROM name as missing
- **AND** does not require code symbols or file names to be renamed
- **AND** unless the TO name also appears under MODIFIED, verifies that the behavior of the baseline requirement (its body and scenarios in the main spec, under the FROM name, or under the TO name only when the main spec is already synced) is still implemented
- **AND** reports CRITICAL "Renamed requirement not found" when that behavior is missing
- **AND** marks spec coverage as not verified for the entry when the baseline requirement cannot be found or read

#### Scenario: Change that only removes or renames requirements
- **WHEN** the delta specs are readable and contain at least one REMOVED or RENAMED requirement but no ADDED or MODIFIED requirements
- **THEN** the agent reports requirement implementation mapping and scenario coverage as not applicable
- **AND** does not mark them as not verified or withhold readiness because of them
- **AND** a delta spec with no parseable requirements still marks them as not verified

### Requirement: Coherence Verification
The agent SHALL verify that implementation is sensible and follows design decisions.

#### Scenario: Design.md adherence check
- **WHEN** verifying coherence
- **AND** design.md exists for the change
- **THEN** extract key decisions from design.md
- **AND** verify implementation follows those decisions
- **AND** report any deviations

#### Scenario: No design.md
- **WHEN** verifying coherence
- **AND** no design.md exists
- **THEN** skip design adherence check
- **AND** report "Design Adherence: Not verified (No design.md to verify against)"

#### Scenario: Design decision followed
- **WHEN** implementation follows a design decision
- **THEN** report as confirmed
- **AND** cite evidence from code

#### Scenario: Design decision violated
- **WHEN** implementation contradicts a design decision
- **THEN** report as WARNING
- **AND** explain the contradiction
- **AND** suggest: either update implementation or update design.md

#### Scenario: Code pattern consistency
- **WHEN** verifying coherence
- **AND** available artifacts support identifying implementation changes beyond a tasks-only check
- **THEN** check if new code follows existing project patterns
- **AND** flag any significant deviations as suggestions
- **AND** report Code Pattern Consistency as not verified if implementation changes cannot be identified

### Requirement: Verification Report Format
The agent SHALL produce a structured, prioritized report.

#### Scenario: Report summary
- **WHEN** verification completes
- **THEN** display summary scorecard:
  ```text
  ## Verification Report: <change-name>

  ### Summary
  | Dimension    | Status   |
  |--------------|----------|
  | Completeness | X/Y      |
  | Correctness  | X/Y      |
  | Coherence    | Followed |
  ```
- **AND** report `Not verified (<reason>)` for every skipped or partially verified check in its dimension's status
- **AND** never count a skipped check as passing

#### Scenario: Issue prioritization
- **WHEN** issues are found
- **THEN** group and display in priority order:
  1. CRITICAL - Must fix before archive (missing implementation, incomplete tasks)
  2. WARNING - Should fix (divergence from spec/design, missing tests)
  3. SUGGESTION - Nice to fix (pattern inconsistencies, minor improvements)

#### Scenario: Actionable recommendations
- **WHEN** reporting an issue
- **THEN** include specific, actionable fix recommendation
- **AND** reference relevant files and line numbers where applicable
- **AND** avoid vague suggestions like "consider reviewing"

#### Scenario: All checks pass
- **WHEN** every applicable check ran and no issues were found across all dimensions
- **THEN** display:
  ```text
  All checks passed. Ready for archive.
  ```

#### Scenario: Critical issues found
- **WHEN** CRITICAL issues exist
- **THEN** display:
  ```text
  X critical issue(s) found. Fix before archiving.
  ```
- **AND** do NOT suggest running archive
- **AND** name every skipped check and its reason, if any

#### Scenario: Only warnings
- **WHEN** every applicable check ran and no CRITICAL issues but warnings exist
- **THEN** display:
  ```text
  No critical issues. Y warning(s) to consider.
  Ready for archive (with noted improvements).
  ```

#### Scenario: Only suggestions
- **WHEN** every applicable check ran and only suggestions exist
- **THEN** report "No critical issues or warnings. Z suggestion(s) to consider. Ready for archive (with noted improvements)."

#### Scenario: Checks skipped
- **WHEN** any check was skipped or partially verified and no CRITICAL issues exist
- **THEN** report "No critical issues found in the checks that ran"
- **AND** name every unverified check and its reason
- **AND** include the warning count when nonzero
- **AND** do not claim archive readiness

#### Scenario: Suggestions in final assessment
- **WHEN** suggestions exist
- **THEN** include their count in the final assessment, including assessments with critical issues or skipped checks

### Requirement: Flexible Artifact Handling
The agent SHALL gracefully handle changes with varying artifact completeness.

#### Scenario: Minimal change (tasks only)
- **WHEN** change has only tasks.md
- **THEN** verify task completion only
- **AND** skip spec and design checks
- **AND** note which checks were skipped

#### Scenario: Change with specs but no design
- **WHEN** change has tasks.md and delta specs but no design.md
- **THEN** verify completeness and correctness
- **AND** skip design adherence
- **AND** still check code coherence against project patterns

#### Scenario: Full change (all artifacts)
- **WHEN** change has proposal, design, specs, and tasks
- **THEN** perform all verification checks
- **AND** cross-reference artifacts for consistency

#### Scenario: Unusable or partial artifact evidence
- **WHEN** an artifact cannot be read or lacks usable requirements, scenarios, or design decisions
- **THEN** mark each affected check as not verified with its reason
- **AND** continue checks supported by the remaining evidence without treating partial coverage as a fully verified check

#### Scenario: Intentional artifact omissions
- **WHEN** a check has no supporting artifacts because the schema omits task tracking or optional artifacts, or the change declares `skip_specs: true`
- **THEN** report the corresponding checks as not applicable and explain why
- **AND** exclude not-applicable checks from skipped-check counts and readiness assessment
- **AND** do not require or create optional or intentionally skipped artifacts to obtain a passing report
- **AND** treat verification as advisory: not verified describes missing evidence for an applicable check, not a new archive gate
- **AND** leave archive checks and user-confirmation behavior unchanged
