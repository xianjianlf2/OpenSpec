/**
 * A Markdown task line: a list item carrying a checkbox that holds at most one
 * non-whitespace marker - `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[]`, `[~]`, `[ x ]` all qualify - under
 * any CommonMark list marker - `-`, `*`, `+`, or an ordered `1.` / `1)` of up
 * to nine digits. Reading only `-` and `*` left an unchecked `1. [ ]` or
 * `+ [ ]` task out of every count, so archive reported "✓ Complete" over it.
 *
 * Leading whitespace is allowed so nested sub-tasks count like their parents.
 * Anchoring at column 0 made `  - [ ] 1.1.1 ...` invisible to progress, to the
 * apply task list, and to archive's incomplete-task check, so a change with
 * unfinished sub-tasks reported "✓ Complete" and archived without a warning.
 *
 * The marker is no longer restricted to ` `/`x`/`X`, because a checkbox this
 * pattern rejects is a line that counts toward neither the numerator nor the
 * denominator: a tasks.md whose remaining work was written `- [~] ...`
 * reported "✓ Complete" and archived with no incomplete-task warning, and
 * marking items `[~]` *shrank* the denominator instead of leaving them counted
 * as not-done (#1761). An empty `[]` and a padded `[ x]` were lost the same
 * silent way. Only `x`/`X` means done, so every unrecognised marker reads as
 * not-done - the conservative default, and no new concept: OpenSpec does not
 * adopt `[~]` or any other marker's meaning, it just stops dropping the line.
 *
 * Permissive on purpose, and safe to keep that way: any character class
 * tightened here drops lines that used to count, and a task this parser drops
 * is a task `openspec archive` stops warning about. The cost of the wide class
 * is over-counting - `- [1] ...` in a tasks file now reads as one unfinished
 * task - which is a loud, correctable false positive, unlike the silent loss.
 *
 * Where the width stops, and why: the marker is one token, so a *multi*
 * character bracket stays unmatched. Widening to `[^\]]*` would swallow the
 * commonest bullet in Markdown - `- [Some doc](./doc.md)`, whose `]` is
 * followed by `(`, not by a space - and turn every link list into phantom
 * unfinished work. A dropped `- [WIP] ...` is the accepted residue of keeping
 * link bullets out; report it as a bug in this trade, not in the marker set.
 *
 * One-character labels need the same guard, which the width alone does not
 * give: `- [A](https://example.com)` and `- [1](./one)` are a link bullet and
 * a reference-link bullet, not tasks, yet their label is a single token and
 * would match. So the closing bracket may not be followed by `(` or `[`, the
 * only two characters that continue Markdown link syntax. A checkbox is
 * followed by its description or by end of line, and `- [x]done` still parses.
 * The one exception is a whitespace-only box: `- [ ](...)` and `- [ ][...]`
 * matched the strict pattern as unfinished tasks, so they still count. The guard
 * may drop only lines that could never hide open work.
 *
 * Deliberately unanchored at the end: `.` does not match `\r`, so writing the
 * description group as `(.*)$` would reject every line of a CRLF tasks.md.
