 * First-run hint pointing users at opt-in shell completions.

 * This hint used to be an npm `postinstall` script. Printing it from the CLI
 * instead lets the package ship with no install scripts at all, so `npm install`
 * no longer emits an `allow-scripts` warning. Completions stay opt-in: the tip
 * only names the command, it never installs anything.
 *
 * The tip goes to stderr, never stdout, so it cannot contaminate piped command
 * output.
 *
 * The tip is suppressed when:
 * - CI is set (any value npm/telemetry would treat as CI)
 * - OPENSPEC_NO_COMPLETIONS=1
 * - completions are already installed, or the shell is one the installer would
 *   reject
 * - the caller passes `silent` — JSON runs, `openspec completion ...`, and
 *   non-TTY runs, which are deferred rather than consumed (see `silent`)
