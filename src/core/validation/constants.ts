Ensure your change has a specs/ directory with capability folders (e.g. specs/http-server/spec.md) containing .md files that use delta headers (## ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements) and that each requirement includes at least one "#### Scenario:" block. If this change intentionally modifies no specs (pure refactor, tooling, docs), set "skip_specs: true" in the change\'s .openspec.yaml instead.
