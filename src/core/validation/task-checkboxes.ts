 * document set out on checkbox count first.
 *
 * Matches at any indent; the caller decides how deep is too deep. See
 * `CODE_BLOCK_COLUMN`.
 *
 * A thematic break (`---`, `***`, `- - -`) is not a list item: the run has no
 * text after it, and this pattern requires a non-space character. `* * *` is
 * the one break spelled like a list of `*` items, and it is accepted as a list
 * item rather than special-cased, because a file whose only list-shaped line is
 * a horizontal rule still has zero tasks — the warning stays true, it just
 * points at an odd line.
 *
 * An ordered marker runs at most nine digits, as CommonMark and the scenario
 * bullet pattern in `specs-apply.ts` both require.

 * blocks, HTML comments, YAML front matter and top-level indented code are
