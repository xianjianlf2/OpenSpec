// Single source of truth for the documentation site's content.
//
// The pages under `content/docs/` are NOT authored by hand. They are generated
// from the repository's `docs-lab/**/*.md` files by `scripts/sync-docs.mjs`
// (which runs as the first step of `npm run build` / `npm run dev`). Edit the
// docs in `../docs-lab`, and the site mirrors them automatically, both locally
// and in CI.
//
// This manifest is the only place that decides which docs are published, their
// slug/URL, and their sidebar section and order.
//
// `source` is a path relative to the repo root's `docs-lab/` directory.
// `slug`   is the page path under `/docs/`.
//
// A section's `pages` list may also hold a folder entry
// (`{ folder, label, pages }`): its pages publish under `<folder>/...` slugs
// and the sidebar shows them as a collapsible group inside the section. A page
// with slug `<folder>/index` is the folder's landing page (served at
// `/docs/<folder>`). Folder entries may nest: a folder's `pages` list may hold
// another folder entry (`folder` is always the full path, e.g.
// `schemas/spec-driven`), rendered as a collapsible group inside the group.
//
// Page descriptions come from each page's leading `> ...` blockquote, lifted
// into frontmatter by sync-docs.mjs. Don't duplicate them here.
