# Installation

> Install the `openspec` CLI on your machine, update it, and uninstall it.


## Prerequisites

OpenSpec is a Node.js CLI. You need version 20.19.0 or newer.

In your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

If that prints `v20.19.0` or higher, you're set. If not, install a newer Node from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or through your version manager (nvm, fnm, asdf, volta).

The workflow itself runs inside an AI coding tool: Claude Code, Cursor, or any other tool on the [supported list](../reference/supported-tools.md).

## Install with your AI assistant

Paste this into your AI chat:

```text
Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/main/install.md and follow it.
```

Or, in your terminal, pipe it into a CLI agent (Claude Code shown):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/main/install.md | claude
```

That fetches [install.md at the repo root](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/blob/main/install.md), a prompt written for any agent that can run shell commands (a few IDE integrations can't). Expect your assistant to:

1. Check your Node version, and stop if it's older than 20.19.0.
2. Skip the install if the CLI is already on your machine. Otherwise, show you the install command and wait for your confirmation before running it.
3. Verify `openspec` is on your PATH.
4. Name the folder it thinks you mean, suggest the AI tool you're already talking to, and ask which others you use, then run `openspec init` there (the [project setup](setup.md) step).
5. Report what init created and the exact spelling to invoke OpenSpec in your tool.

It stops before anything privileged and never edits your shell startup files. The [manual methods below](#install-methods) are the source of truth, and the prompt runs them for you.

This install method is new and can have varying results depending on model used. Only use if you're comfortable correcting AI mistakes. Otherwise we recommend following the standard method below.

## Install methods

Install the CLI globally; [setting up your project](setup.md) comes after.

In your terminal:

```npm
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

### Yarn

`yarn global add` is Yarn Classic (1.x) only. Modern Yarn removed global installs, so use npm, pnpm, or bun instead. A global CLI doesn't have to share your project's package manager.

### Bun

Bun installs OpenSpec but doesn't run it, so you still need Node on your machine (the [prerequisite](#prerequisites) above). Without it, every command fails with `env: node: No such file or directory`. Bun treats [every Node CLI](https://bun.com/docs/pm/bunx#shebangs) this way.

### Deno

Deno installs the CLI from npm and needs explicit permission flags. In your terminal:

```bash
deno install --global \
  --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-sys=cpus,homedir --allow-net=edge.openspec.dev \
  npm:@fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

Some commands launch another program: [`openspec config edit`](../reference/cli.md) opens your editor. Deno interrupts those with a permission prompt on every run. To stop it asking, add a scoped `--allow-run=<program>` to the install command.

> [!NOTE]
> If Deno can't resolve `@latest`, pin a version range instead: `npm:@fission-ai/openspec@^1.7.0`.

### Nix

The OpenSpec repo ships a Nix flake. Install it into your profile. In your terminal:

```bash
nix profile install github:Fission-AI/OpenSpec
```

Or run a one-off command first, without installing:

```bash
nix run github:Fission-AI/OpenSpec -- --version
```

That leaves nothing on your PATH, so there's no install to check afterward.

To put OpenSpec in a project dev shell instead, add the flake as an input and use its default package; [flake.nix](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/blob/main/flake.nix) lists the outputs.

### Check it worked

Whichever method you used, in your terminal:

```bash
openspec --version
```

If that prints a version number, the CLI is on your PATH. It installs once per machine.

Next, [set up your project](setup.md). If your assistant already ran init, that page shows what it wrote and how to adjust it.

## Updating

In your terminal, in each project where you ran init:

```bash
openspec update
```

When a newer CLI is out, [`openspec update`](../reference/cli.md#openspec-update) says so and can install it for you; that upgrade is once per machine. Every run refreshes the project's generated skills and commands, which never update on their own. A current project prints `✓ All 2 tool(s) up to date (v1.7.0)`.


> [!WARNING]
> On Deno, re-run the [Deno install](#deno) with `-f`; it won't overwrite the installed command without it. On Nix, use `nix profile upgrade openspec`.

> [!NOTE]
> A global npm install belongs to one Node installation. Switch Node versions with nvm and the `openspec` command doesn't come along, so install it again under the new version.

## Uninstalling

To uninstall OpenSpec, run through the steps below; none of them touch your source code. You can also point your agent at this section and let it handle the removal.

**1. Remove [shell completions](../reference/cli.md#openspec-completion)**, if you set them up, while the CLI can still do it. In your terminal:

```bash
openspec completion uninstall
```

**2. Remove the package.** In your terminal:

```npm
npm uninstall -g @fission-ai/openspec
```

On Deno: `deno uninstall --global openspec`. On Nix: `nix profile remove openspec`. Your shell should no longer find `openspec`.

**3. Delete what's left, or keep it.**

- Generated agent files: `openspec-*` skills and `opsx` commands under directories like `.claude/` or `.agents/`, per project. [Supported tools](../reference/supported-tools.md) lists each tool's paths; MiniMax Code keeps skills in `~/.minimax/skills`.
- Leftovers from older versions: marker blocks in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` (delete the block, keep the file) and `opsx-*.md` prompts in `~/.codex/prompts`.
- The `openspec/` folder: pause first. `specs/` and `changes/archive/` are your record of the system, plain Markdown that reads fine without OpenSpec.
- Per-machine state: settings and the telemetry id in `~/.config/openspec/`; schema overrides and store registrations in `~/.local/share/openspec/` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\openspec`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\openspec`). Registrations are pointers; the store repos they point to are untouched.
