# docs-lab: parallel rebuild of the OpenSpec docs

**Status: prose is landing page by page; the rest are skeletons** (real headings plus a
one-line `>` job statement the site lifts into the page description). The live site
builds from this tree: `website/docs.sync.config.mjs` maps these files to published
pages, and the old `docs/` tree is no longer used by the site.

This README owns the structure: which pages exist and which page teaches what. The
reverse view, from a job or message to the page that owns it, is
[message-map.md](message-map.md). How to
write them (style, voice, formatting) is the `write-openspec-docs` skill's
[writing.md](../.agents/skills/write-openspec-docs/writing.md).

## The bar for every page

Every page in docs-lab is written by hand, from scratch. The old `docs/` tree is source
material for facts, never text to carry over.

What we're after is that the reader gets the idea: every page reads well and makes sense
to anyone, whatever their level of skill, and above all it is simple. The worst thing we
can ship is documentation that is cognitively expensive to understand, and that cost
comes from complicated words, metaphors that don't make sense, random terminology that
isn't explained, and formatting that gets in the way of reading. Every sentence has a
purpose and is easy to read and comprehend. If a sentence doesn't pass that test, rewrite
it or cut it.

## Structure rules

**Folders are the areas.** Every page lives in its area's folder (`start/`,
`guides/`, `customize/`, `multi-repo/`, `reference/`, `help/`); the root holds only this
README, `message-map.md`, and `sources.md`. Most folders publish as one
sidebar group; `guides/` publishes as the Guides group, holding three collapsible
subgroups (Understanding OpenSpec, Using OpenSpec, Adopting OpenSpec), all expanded
by default (held back from the site until the pages are drafted: the whole section is
commented out in `website/docs.sync.config.mjs`, and links to a guide fall back to its
source on GitHub until it's re-listed). Reference holds three nested
folders (`reference/architecture/`, `reference/schemas/`, and
`reference/configuration/`), each publishing as a collapsible group with `index.md` as
its landing page; the spec-driven schema publishes as a single page
(`reference/schemas/spec-driven/index.md`) inside the Schemas group. Labels and URLs come from
`website/docs.sync.config.mjs`, so moving a file never moves a URL.

**Teach once.** The loop (propose, review, apply, archive) has one teacher; every other
page links, never re-teaches:

- `start/quickstart.md` teaches it as UX: how a human moves a change through the
  lifecycle, including what archive does on disk.
- `start/overview.md` shows it as pitch: copy only, no explanation.
- `guides/concepts.md` stays out of it: the page explains the artifacts (specs, changes,
  the delta) and links to the quickstart for the loop. Disk paths appear inline with the
  concept that owns them, never as a layout section.
- `start/installation.md` owns install; `start/setup.md` owns init and what it writes.
  The quickstart opens with one prerequisite line linking both and starts at explore.

**Guides vs reference.** `reference/skills.md` holds each skill's contract: arguments,
what it creates, and what it responds with. Guide pages
(the Using and Adopting subgroups) own the human judgment for a task, including when
to reach for each skill, may span several skills, and never restate skill mechanics.
`reference/architecture/` is the one exception to Reference's look-it-up bar: it's
explanation content, housed here as a pragmatic home while it's three pages. If it
grows (say, by absorbing contributor internals), consider giving it its own folder
and tab.

**Reference is lookup, and named for it.** `reference/schemas/` and
`reference/configuration/` are contracts: keys, values, types, defaults, and
locations, on tables and fences. Anything explanatory (what a schema is, what
to put in config.yaml) lives in Customize or Guides and is linked, never
restated. Naming follows three rules. A reference folder's landing
page is titled "Overview"; the folder label already names the group, and
repeating it double-nests the sidebar. A page documenting one file carries
concept and filename in the title, concept first, where the concept names the
file's use, never just its scope ("Project configuration (config.yaml)", "CLI
settings (config.json)"): the left edge is what the eye disambiguates in the
sidebar, and the filename keeps the title matching what readers search for and
see on disk. A file whose name is the term readers use keeps the filename
alone as the title (`schema.yaml`), and a page owning one product term takes
that term as the title (`spec-driven`), and
a page covering several files takes the concept alone (Stores), naming its
files in the job line.

**FAQ is one-liners.** Every FAQ entry is a short answer, a few lines at most, or a
router link to the page that owns the topic. How-to content never lives in the FAQ:
when an answer outgrows a one-liner, it moves to a guide or reference page and the FAQ
entry becomes a pointer.

## Page index: every page's job

Each goal below is the page's `>` blockquote verbatim, so the promise here is the promise
readers see. A page delivers exactly its goal: content that outgrows it means splitting
the page or rewriting the goal in both places, never letting them drift.

### Start: from "what is this?" to your first archived change

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [Overview](start/overview.md) | _TODO: emptied 2026-08-21 for a from-scratch rewrite and pulled from the site (`/docs` redirects to Installation meanwhile); the old goal line was dropped as too weak a pitch. Brief in Notes.md._ |
| [Installation](start/installation.md) | Install the `openspec` CLI on your machine, update it, and uninstall it. |
| [Set up your project](start/setup.md) | Add OpenSpec to a project: run init, see what it wrote, and adjust it. |
| [Quickstart](start/quickstart.md) | Your first change on your existing repo, from idea to archived. |

### Guides: understand the system, use it well, bring it to your codebase and team

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [Understanding › Concepts](guides/concepts.md) | What the two artifacts are, and how a change describes a diff against current specs. |
| [Using › Explore an idea](guides/explore.md) | Think it through with the agent before you commit to a proposal. |
| [Using › Review the plan](guides/review-the-plan.md) | The two-minute pass that catches wrong turns before they're code. |
| [Using › Apply a change](guides/apply.md) | Run the plan: pacing, context windows, and picking up where you left off. |
| [Using › Change course](guides/change-course.md) | Revise a change in flight, or decide it's cleaner to start fresh. |
| [Adopting › Existing codebases](guides/existing-codebases.md) | Bring OpenSpec to a codebase with a lot of code and no specs: where to start, what to backfill, and how specs grow from there. |
| [Adopting › Teams](guides/teams.md) | Run OpenSpec as a team: what to commit, how a change rides its PR, and when to archive. |

### Customize: make the workflows fit your project

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [Overview](customize/overview.md) | Your options for customizing OpenSpec. |
| [Profiles](customize/profiles.md) | Choose which workflows are installed, and whether they install as skills, commands, or both. |
| [Project configuration](customize/project-config.md) | Make the workflows plan changes the way you want with a few lines in config.yaml. |
| [Schemas](customize/schemas.md) | Change what OpenSpec produces: the artifacts, their order, and their templates. |

### Multi-repo (beta): plan across repository boundaries

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [Stores (beta)](multi-repo/stores.md) | Plan changes that span repositories: one store, many repos. |
| [Worksets (beta)](multi-repo/worksets.md) | Open the store and the repos that use it in one editor window, so your agent sees both. |

### Reference: look it up, exact and complete

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [Skills](reference/skills.md) | Every OpenSpec skill: arguments, what it creates, and what it responds with. |
| [CLI](reference/cli.md) | The `openspec` terminal commands. |
| [Schemas](reference/schemas/index.md) | Every available workflow schema and the artifacts it defines. |
| [Schemas › schema.yaml](reference/schemas/schema-yaml.md) | Every field of a schema definition, for reading or writing one. |
| [Schemas › spec-driven](reference/schemas/spec-driven/index.md) | The default workflow's artifacts: their order, their formats, and the change folder they produce. |
| [Configuration](reference/configuration/index.md) | Every file and setting that changes how OpenSpec behaves, and where each lives. |
| [Configuration › Project configuration (config.yaml)](reference/configuration/config-yaml.md) | Every field of openspec/config.yaml: the schema, context, and rules this project plans with. |
| [Configuration › Change metadata (.openspec.yaml)](reference/configuration/change-metadata.md) | The supported fields and validation rules for the metadata stored with each change. |
| [Configuration › CLI settings (config.json)](reference/configuration/config-json.md) | Every field of config.json: how the openspec CLI behaves on your machine. |
| [Configuration › Environment variables](reference/configuration/environment-variables.md) | Every environment variable OpenSpec reads. |
| [Configuration › Stores](reference/configuration/stores.md) | The files behind multi-repo stores: registry.yaml and store.yaml, and which root a command uses. |
| [Supported tools](reference/supported-tools.md) | Which AI coding tools OpenSpec supports, and each one's command syntax. |
| [Glossary](reference/glossary.md) | Every OpenSpec term, one line each. |
| [Architecture](reference/architecture/index.md) (held back from the site until drafted) | How OPSX is built: internals for the curious. |
| [Architecture › Workflow runs](reference/architecture/workflow-runs.md) | How a workflow run executes, from invocation to written artifacts. |
| [Architecture › Design decisions](reference/architecture/design-decisions.md) | Why OPSX works the way it does. |

### Help: get unstuck (held back from the site until drafted, see Open TODOs)

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [FAQ](help/faq.md) | Short answers to the questions that don't need a page. |
| [Troubleshooting](help/troubleshooting.md) | When OpenSpec doesn't do what you expected: symptoms and their fixes. |

### Legacy: land the old workflow safely (held back from the site until drafted, see Open TODOs)

| Page | Goal |
|---|---|
| [Migrating from the legacy workflow](help/legacy/migration.md) | Moving from the legacy `/openspec:*` commands to OPSX. |

## Old docs

The `docs/` tree is legacy, and the plan is to remove it once docs-lab covers what it
owns. It has become a bit of an AI slop mess, so nothing from it is carried over as text
(see The bar for every page). Until it's removed it stays untouched: fixes land in
docs-lab, never in `docs/`.

[`sources.md`](sources.md) maps every current `docs/` page to its destination here: the
source material while drafting, the redirect list at cutover. Cutover steps are in that
file's [Cutover](sources.md#cutover) section.

## Open TODOs

- Not started: the Architecture pages (`reference/architecture/index.md`,
  `workflow-runs.md`, `design-decisions.md`). All three are headings only, so we hid the
  group from the site on 2026-08-21 (folder entry commented out in
  `website/docs.sync.config.mjs`). The files stay on disk with a WIP comment. Published
  pages that link to them (`reference/glossary.md` to the Overview,
  `customize/project-config.md` to Workflow runs) fall back to the GitHub source until
  the group is re-listed.
- Not started: the Help and Legacy pages (`help/faq.md`, `help/troubleshooting.md`,
  `help/legacy/migration.md`). FAQ has one answer and the other two are headings only, so
  we hid both sections from the site on 2026-08-21 (commented out in
  `website/docs.sync.config.mjs`, same mechanism as Guides). The files stay on disk with
  a WIP comment. Published pages that link to them (`start/setup.md` to FAQ,
  `reference/glossary.md` to Migration) fall back to the GitHub source until the
  sections are re-listed.
- Not started: `start/overview.md` is empty on purpose. We cleared the skeleton
  (headings, narrative beats, diagram gallery) on 2026-08-21 to rewrite the landing page
  from scratch. The old pitch ("a shared, reviewable plan before code is written")
  undersells OpenSpec now that plan mode is everywhere; the rewrite should sell keeping
  larger features on track and aligned (teams, git-native, intended vs implemented
  behavior, control-loop framing). Brief in `Notes.md` ("Start > Overview"); the diagram
  candidates went with the gallery and live in git history. Until the rewrite lands the
  page is off the site: its entry is commented out in `website/docs.sync.config.mjs` and
  `/docs` redirects to Installation (`website/public/_redirects` plus a fallback in the
  docs page route). Restoring it is one uncomment plus removing the two redirects. The
  Teach-once rule still applies: the loop appears here as pitch only.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: spec-driven's design `instruction` lists six
  sections (including Migration Plan and Open Questions) but
  `schemas/spec-driven/templates/design.md` carries only four headers. The docs show
  both verbatim; the mismatch belongs upstream. Noted 2026-08-14 while consolidating
  the spec-driven page.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: `openspec store setup --remote` writes the URL
  into `store.yaml` but never configures a git `origin`, so "setup --remote, then
  `git push -u origin main`" fails as written; the Stores page shows `git remote add`
  instead. The pasteable missing-store fix in `openspec doctor` is powered by
  `references:` remotes, not `store.yaml`. Noted 2026-08-21 while porting the Stores
  page.
- Style guide follow-up (`.agents/skills/write-openspec-docs/writing.md`), from the
  Stores page's review rounds, 2026-08-21: never use a term the page hasn't shown
  (say "the `store:` line", not "the pointer"; define by showing the artifact first);
  when behavior depends on the reader's starting state, enumerate the states and walk
  each to its outcome; sentence subjects are you, OpenSpec, or your agent, never an
  implementation unit ("the resolver picks") or a class of things ("store-only
  projects make..."); when a defined term is reused a section later, re-gloss it in
  one parenthetical at the point of use.
- Fence convention follow-up, 2026-08-21: the Stores page puts commands in `bash`
  fences with a one-line `#` comment and OpenSpec output in a separate `yaml` fence.
  `customize/schemas.md` still uses `console` fences with `$` prompts (lines 78, 114,
  137, 145; prompts at 24 and 115); the style guide should name the convention and
  that page should adopt it.
- Monorepo: message-map row 37 is still a Gap. "Packages treated as separate repos"
  may land on the Stores page later; not part of the current page.

- `reference/cli.md` is fully drafted: the command table plus one section per real
  command, facts captured from working-tree runs (2026-08-11). The `delivery` key that
  start/setup.md's "Skills, commands, or both" section sets appears there only as
  command output; its field-level home, `reference/configuration/config-json.md`, is
  drafted (2026-08-14).
- Telemetry is undocumented. `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` appears nowhere in the tree; the
  Deno install command grants `--allow-net=edge.openspec.dev` with no explanation (the
  telemetry gloss was deliberately pulled pending a real home). The home now exists:
  write `reference/configuration/environment-variables.md` (the env var, what's
  collected, the opt-out, the CI auto-disable), then have the Deno section link to it
  to explain the flag. Noted 2026-08-07; home settled 2026-08-10.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: init doesn't say when the global profile changed what
  it wrote. A machine with `profile: custom` silently installs a different workflow set
  than a stock machine, and nothing in the init output names the profile that shaped it.
  Noted 2026-08-05 while verifying installation.md; track upstream, don't paper over in prose.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: drop the sync-specs skill from the default set; its
  job reads as reference content, not a workflow, and it pads the skill list every reader
  scans. Noted 2026-08-08 while writing start/setup.md's workflow tree.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: make the shared `.agents/` folder the default install
  target for every tool, with tool-specific folders (`.claude/`, ...) the exception. The
  docs already prefer `.agents/` in examples; the product should match. Noted 2026-08-08.
- `help/troubleshooting.md`'s skeleton has no section for install-time failures
  (`command not found`, wrong Node version, PATH). Old `docs/troubleshooting.md` covered
  them; `start/installation.md` carries caveats inline but there is no symptom-to-fix
  home. Add a section or an installation.md anchor. Noted 2026-08-10 during the old-docs
  message audit.
- Missing guide: the iterative flow. new/continue/fast-forward have no owner for the
  judgment: what the flow is, when to pick it over propose, and ff vs continue. Old
  `docs/workflows.md` covered it (Two Modes, When to Use What); `sources.md` routes that
  page's mechanics to `guides/apply.md` and contracts to `reference/skills.md`, so the
  choice itself landed nowhere. Likely a Guides › Using page slotted between Explore and
  Review the plan, with a pointer to `customize/profiles.md` (the skills are optional
  workflows outside the core set). Salvage only the ff-vs-continue rule of thumb; the rest of
  workflows.md is unverified. Noted 2026-08-11. Related: message-map row 29 words
  apply.md's pacing question as drafting-time pacing, the same creation-stage choice;
  fix that row's wording or owner when this guide lands. Noted 2026-08-14.
- Missing guide: working with git. OpenSpec never touches git, so every git decision
  lands on the reader with no page to answer it: do you branch before or after propose,
  does a task get its own commit, what goes in the PR, where does the archive commit
  land. `guides/teams.md` owns the archive-vs-PR ordering; the rest is unowned. Likely a
  `guides/` file in the Adoption group. Noted 2026-08-08.
- `customize/skills.md` is parked: the skeleton stays on disk but is out of the page
  index, the sidebar, and the sync config. Editing installed skill prompts has no good
  answer yet (`openspec update` overwrites edits); the message map keeps the question as
  a Gap. Revive when the product has a real story for surviving updates. Parked 2026-08-14.
- `guides/examples.md` is parked: the skeleton stays on disk but is out of the page
  index, the sidebar, and the sync config. Contrived examples teach the wrong lesson for
  this product; revive the page when real archived changes from actual usage can fill it.
  The content plan (weak-vs-reviewed pairs, archived-changes gallery) is in the file's
  comment. Parked 2026-08-11.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: "expanded" survives in product strings and the
  update workflow is unlabeled in the picker. The only stored profile values are core
  and custom, but `src/core/templates/workflows/update-change.ts` says "expanded-profile
  workflow", and `WORKFLOW_PROMPT_META` (`src/commands/config.ts`) has no `update` entry,
  so the `openspec config` workflow picker renders a core workflow as raw `update` /
  "Workflow: update". Docs standardized on core/custom with "expand the set" as a verb
  (2026-08-12). Noted 2026-08-12 during the glossary product sweep.
- Product feedback, not a docs task: converge on skills only, soon. A workflow's skill and
  command are the same instructions, Claude Code has already merged commands into skills
  upstream, and setup spends a whole subsection explaining why two forms exist. Every page
  gets simpler when commands go. Noted 2026-08-08 while writing start/setup.md.
- Website QOL backlog, site build not prose: i18n; AI search layered on the stock keyword
  search (an ask-the-docs answer box, not just matching); proper light/dark themes that
  carry the Survey palette (DESIGN.md tokens) into both modes instead of a stock dark
  theme. Candidates to bundle in the same pass: `llms.txt` plus a per-page "copy as
  Markdown" button so agents can ingest pages, copy buttons on code blocks, and
  "edit this page on GitHub" links. Noted 2026-08-11.
