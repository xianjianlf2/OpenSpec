# schema.yaml

> Every field of a schema definition, for reading or writing one.

`schema.yaml` lists the planning files a workflow creates. It also defines their order and the handoff to implementation.

## Location

A project schema lives under `openspec/schemas/<name>/`:

```text
openspec/schemas/review-first/
├── schema.yaml
└── templates/
    ├── proposal.md
    └── tasks.md
```

OpenSpec checks three places for that directory. The first match wins.

| Copy | Directory |
|---|---|
| **1. Project** | `<project>/openspec/schemas/<name>/` |
| **2. User, macOS and Linux** | `~/.local/share/openspec/schemas/<name>/` |
| **2. User, Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\openspec\schemas\<name>\` |
| **3. Package** | The schemas installed with the CLI |

If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, the user directory moves to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/openspec/schemas/<name>/` on every platform.

The directory name is the lookup key used by `--schema`, `config.yaml`, and [`.openspec.yaml`](../configuration/change-metadata.md#schema). If the `name` field differs from the directory name, OpenSpec still uses the directory name for lookup.

[`openspec schema which <name>`](../cli.md#openspec-schema-which) prints the active directory and any lower-priority copies it hides.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `name` | **Required.** A non-empty string stored as the schema name. Lookup still uses the directory name. |
| `version` | **Required.** A positive integer stored as the schema revision. The value doesn't change OpenSpec's behavior. |
| `description` | An optional string printed by `openspec schemas`. With no value, the schema has no description. |
| `artifacts` | **Required.** A non-empty list of [artifact entries](#artifact-fields). |
| `apply` | Optional [apply settings](#apply-fields). With no block, OpenSpec uses the [apply defaults](#apply-defaults). |

## Artifact fields

Each entry under `artifacts` defines one planning file or set of files.

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `id` | **Required.** A unique, non-empty string used in dependencies, project rules, commands, and apply settings. |
| `generates` | **Required.** A relative path or glob telling the agent where to write the artifact inside the change folder. |
| `description` | **Required.** A string that labels the artifact in instructions sent to the agent. |
| `template` | **Required.** A relative path to the artifact's format in the schema's `templates/` folder. |
| `instruction` | Optional guidance telling the agent what content to produce. |
| `requires` | A list of artifact IDs that must be complete first. Default: `[]`. |

### `generates`

The path starts from the change folder. For a change named `add-auth`:

```yaml
generates: proposal.md
```

The artifact goes here:

```text
openspec/changes/add-auth/proposal.md
```

A glob can match several files:

```yaml
generates: specs/**/*.md
```

This matches Markdown files below `openspec/changes/add-auth/specs/`.

OpenSpec recognizes these glob forms in `generates`:

- **Wildcards and character classes**: values containing `*`, `?`, or `[`, such as `specs/**/*.md` and `review-[ab].md`.
- **Brace expansions**: alternatives such as `review-{api,ui}.md` and ranges such as `file-{1..3}.md`.
- **Extglobs**: patterns such as `@(proposal|design).md`, `+(proposal|design).md`, and `!(proposal|design).md`.

**Literal filenames**: a leading `!` alone does not make a glob. Use `generates: '!review.md'` to name that file. Plain parentheses such as `(proposal|design).md` and single-element braces such as `review-{api}.md` also remain literal.

OpenSpec rejects absolute paths and paths containing a `..` segment.

#### Completion

OpenSpec checks whether the output exists. It doesn't read the file to decide whether the artifact is complete.

| `generates` value | Complete when |
|---|---|
| `proposal.md` | That file exists. |
| `specs/**/*.md` | The glob matches at least one file. |

### `template`

The path starts from the schema's `templates/` folder. In the `review-first` schema:

```yaml
template: proposal.md
```

OpenSpec reads this file:

```text
openspec/schemas/review-first/templates/proposal.md
```

OpenSpec gives the template's contents to the agent as the output format. It doesn't copy the template into the change folder.

OpenSpec rejects absolute paths and paths containing a `..` segment.

### `requires`

- **Dependencies**: every ID in `requires` must name another artifact in the same schema.
- **Ready state**: an artifact becomes ready after all its dependencies are complete.
- **Invalid graphs**: missing IDs, duplicate IDs, and dependency cycles fail validation.
- **Ties**: when several artifacts are ready, their order in `artifacts` decides which one OpenSpec returns first.

## Apply fields

`apply` defines what must exist before implementation starts.

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `requires` | **Required.** A non-empty list of artifacts that must exist before apply instructions become ready. |
| `tracks` | An optional relative path or glob for Markdown task files in the change folder. Default: `null`. |
| `instruction` | Optional guidance sent to the agent when apply is ready. OpenSpec uses built-in guidance by default. |

Artifact `requires` controls planning order. `apply.requires` controls when apply instructions become ready.

### `tracks`

The path starts from the change folder. For a change named `add-auth`, `tracks: tasks.md` reads:

```text
openspec/changes/add-auth/tasks.md
```

A glob such as `tracks: "**/tasks.md"` reads every matching file, such as `backend/tasks.md` and `frontend/tasks.md`. OpenSpec combines their tasks and progress. Use the same value for an artifact's `generates` field so status and list track the same files.

Apply stays blocked if no file matches or the matched files contain no checkbox with task text. OpenSpec counts these checkbox forms:

```markdown
- [ ] Pending task
- [x] Completed task
* [X] Completed task
+ [ ] Pending task
1. [ ] Pending task
2) [x] Completed task
```

Any Markdown list marker works: `-`, `*`, `+`, or a number of up to nine digits followed by `.` or `)`. Leading spaces are allowed. The [tasks.md section of the spec-driven page](spec-driven/index.md#tasksmd) defines the stricter format produced by the default schema.

The tracked files drive the apply state:

- **`blocked`**: no file matches, or no readable file has a checkbox with task text.
- **`ready`**: at least one task is pending, or a matched file could not be read while another provides tasks.
- **`all_done`**: every tracked task is checked and every matched file was read.

If a matched file cannot be read, apply keeps the tasks and progress from readable files but does not mark the change `all_done`. [Apply JSON output](../cli.md#openspec-instructions) identifies each unavailable file and the reason.

OpenSpec rejects absolute paths and paths containing a `..` segment.

### Apply defaults

| Behavior | Default |
|---|---|
| Required artifacts | Every artifact in the schema |
| Progress tracking | No tracked file |
| Agent guidance | Built-in apply guidance |

## Complete example

```yaml
name: review-first
version: 1
description: Proposal and implementation checklist

artifacts:
  - id: proposal
    generates: proposal.md
    description: Why the change is needed and what it affects
    template: proposal.md
    instruction: |
      Explain the problem, the proposed change, and its impact.
    requires: []

  - id: tasks
    generates: tasks.md
    description: Trackable implementation checklist
    template: tasks.md
    instruction: |
      Break the approved proposal into ordered implementation tasks.
    requires:
      - proposal

apply:
  requires:
    - tasks
  tracks: tasks.md
  instruction: |
    Work through the pending tasks and mark each one complete.
```

## Validation

[`openspec schema validate <name>`](../cli.md#openspec-schema-validate) checks:

- Field types and required fields
- Relative paths
- Artifact IDs, dependencies, and cycles
- `apply.requires` IDs: each must be an artifact in the schema
- Template files

A schema with an unknown `apply.requires` ID doesn't load, so every command that uses it reports the error.

Validation warns, without failing, when `apply.tracks` isn't exactly equal to some artifact's `generates` value. OpenSpec finds the tracked artifact by comparing those two strings, so anything else leaves it unable to tell which artifact's progress the file belongs to. That includes a typo like `task.md`, and also `tracks: tasks/main.md` against `generates: tasks/*.md`, where the glob does produce the file but the strings still differ. Apply keeps reading the file either way, but `openspec list` and `openspec status` count `tasks.md` instead.

Validation doesn't catch these mistakes:

| Mistake | What happens |
|---|---|
| A field is misspelled, such as `instrution` | OpenSpec ignores it. Validation doesn't report the typo. |
| `name` differs from the schema directory | Validation passes. OpenSpec still uses the directory name for lookup. |
